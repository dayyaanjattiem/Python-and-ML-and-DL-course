# Python-and-ML-and-DL-course
Master Python Programming Fundamentals and Harness the Power of ML to Solve Real-World Practical Applications in Finance

Executive Summary
The purpose of this project is to gain insight by using data driven decision making to attempt in predicting the stock market and future prices. 
The project will be composed of three components. 
- Technical Analysis
  - SMA 10, 21, 100, 200
- Machine Learning and Deep Learning
- Financial Ratios
    - Forward PE
    - EPS



Technical Analysis

The first component of the technical analysis will be to create SMAs on the close price and utilize various SMAs to forecast future prices. 

The second step would be to analyze the gradient by taking the first derivative of the SMA to analyze the change in SMAs values and find out what information this tells us 


Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis

Test 1:
- Create a Linear Regression Model that utelises the volume to determine the f(volume)= stock prices.
- It is probable that the model will not be able to determine the stock prices if the volume changes since the market price of a stock is not only dependent on the volume.
- That filters us down to test 1.1

  Test 1.1:
  - Test the correlation between volume and stock prices
  - Create a linear regression model that determines the stock prices utelising the first derivatives of stock prices and volume.
  - Test the the correlation between the gradients of the volume and stock prices
